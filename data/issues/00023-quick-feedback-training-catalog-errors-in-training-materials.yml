  ### What's on your mind?
  
  Hello,
  I detected a few things that may be improved in the training material site:
  
  - I cannot edit metadata from training materials that do not belong to me. At least, I would like to propose fixes to things like keywords or URLs.
  - In https://everse-training.app.cern.ch/materials/software-carpentry it is not clear what course from the carpentry this is linking. For example, it shows in "license", but it is not clear how do I get to any course about licenses.
  - https://everse-training.app.cern.ch/materials/software-metadata-extraction-framework-somef is not a training material, but a tool for metadata extraction. It can be used to comply with metadata requirements, but per se it's not a training material. Maybe remove?
  
  ### What was your goal? (optional)
  Finding courses on good practices for software metadata/license
