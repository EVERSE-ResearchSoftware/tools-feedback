  ### What's on your mind?
  
  Hi
  Transferring feedback received orally.
  
  The "All tools and resources" page in RSQKit lacks clarity in its purpose, as it does more than just list quality tools. 
  Moreover, it was unclear if that list could be updated, and if yes how.
  This ambiguity is further amplified by the TechRadar, which provides a different list.
  
  My take or suggestion: is the  "All tools and resources" page really needed or the pop-ups in the other pages (e.g. tasks) sufficient?
  
  
  ### What was your goal? (optional)
