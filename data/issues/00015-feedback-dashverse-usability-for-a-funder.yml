  ### What did you like most about the system?
  
  It looks nice
  
  ### What aspects need the most improvement?
  
  As a funder, I want to know if the project I funded (or to fund) follows FAIR principles for software.
  I need to easily run EVERSE assessments on this software (at the moment I needed to install resqui - too complicated - but I'll focus on DashVerse here).
  I could not find the specific software I assessed in the DashVerse and could not identify if it passes the assessments, nor which assessments.
  
  ### Any other comments or suggestions?
  
  - A search box to find my software would be nice
  - A clear list of the indicators that have been tested and the result
  
  ### Your scientific domain or cluster
  
  None
  
  ### Your role
  
  Policy maker
  
  ### What is your primary use case?
  
  A funder who needs to assess the software I will fund
