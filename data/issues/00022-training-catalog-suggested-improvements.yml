  Based on Eleonora’s feedback , here are some suggestions to improve the feedback template:
  
  - Replace the word “system”
  
   Everywhere in the survey, replace “system” with “EVERSE training catalogue”.
  
  - Add RSQKit link
  
  For the question about the connection with RSQKit, include a direct link to RSQKit.
  
  - Clarify question 7
  
  Check what exactly question 7 is measuring.
  
  - People might have biased presumptions about what other people can / cannot do on a web interface. Only their own personal experience as user with the system is valid for us.
  
  - Redundancy between questions 2 and 8
  
  Question 2: “complex”
  
  Question 8: “cumbersome”
  
  These seem very similar and could be merged or reworded to avoid redundancy.
