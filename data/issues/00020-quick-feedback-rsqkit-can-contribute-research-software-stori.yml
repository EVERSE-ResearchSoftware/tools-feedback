  ### Which service are you reviewing?
  
  RSQKit
  
  ### How would you rate your experience?
  
  🙂 Good
  
  ### What's on your mind?
  
  Hi
  I am transferring some feedback received orally concerning the RSQKit. It was unclear to them if they could contribute a [research software story](https://everse.software/RSQKit/research_software_stories).
  
  It could be either clarified explicitly in the contributing section, or with a call to action on the page if that's what we want.
  
  ### What was your goal? (optional)
  
  _No response_
