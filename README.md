## 📥 How to Provide Feedback

We value input from both **users** (researchers, developers) and **domain experts** (community leads, RSE managers).

### 1. Structured Issues (Preferred)

Please use our [Issue Templates](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/tools-feedback/issues) to ensure your feedback is routed correctly:

* **🐛 Bug Report:** Encountered a technical problem? Let us know.
* **💡 Feature Request:** Have a requirement for a new functionality?
* **🎓 Expert Community Review:** Deep-dive technical or domain-specific assessments.
* **💬 General Remarks:** Anything that doesn't fit the above.

### 2. Workshop & External Data

We collect feedback at the GAM and during dedicated sessions. To add the outcome of such feedback rounds to the repository

1. Navigate to the `/data` directory.
2. Open a Pull Request to upload your export (PDF, CSV, or Markdown summary).
3. Name your file or folder using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-Workshop-Name` or similar.

Here, you can also add "random feedback" that does not fit the issue format.

## 📊 Feedback Organization

To keep the community informed on how their feedback is being used, we organize all input into a global dashboard:

👉 **Kanban board will follow**

We use labels to categorize feedback:

* `project:[tool-name]` — Which tool the feedback belongs to.
* `persona:expert` — Insights from community experts.
* `status:planned` — Feedback that has been accepted into the roadmap.
* `type:bug` — Type of issue as indicated above.
